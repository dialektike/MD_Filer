# Algorithms Study Notes

## Sorting Algorithms

### Quick Sort
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case
- **Space Complexity**: O(log n)
- Uses divide-and-conquer approach
- Very efficient for large datasets

### Merge Sort
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) always
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
- Stable sorting algorithm
- Good for linked lists

## Graph Algorithms

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Finds shortest path from source to all vertices
- Works with non-negative edge weights
- Uses priority queue for efficiency

### BFS vs DFS
- **BFS**: Level-order traversal, shortest path in unweighted graphs
- **DFS**: Explores deep before backtracking, good for cycle detection

## Dynamic Programming

Key principles:
1. Optimal substructure
2. Overlapping subproblems
3. Memoization or tabulation

Classic examples:
- Fibonacci sequence
- Knapsack problem
- Longest common subsequence

## Practice Resources
- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- Codeforces
